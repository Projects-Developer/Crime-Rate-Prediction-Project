## Abstract
This project presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting crime rates in various regions. Utilizing historical crime data, demographic information, and environmental factors, we develop a predictive model that identifies patterns and correlations, enabling law enforcement agencies and policymakers to make informed decisions. Our results demonstrate the potential of data-driven approaches in improving public safety and reducing crime rates.
